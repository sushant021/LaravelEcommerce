			<p><strong>Security of personal information</strong></p>

			<p>KKFC will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any personal information recorded, and to keep this information complete, accurate and up to date. All information is passed through to a secure server using encryption technology and stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities, which in some cases may be overseas. KKFC employees and data processors are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by KKFC. However, security of communications over the Internet cannot be guaranteed, and therefore absolute assurance that information will be secure at all times cannot be given. KKFC will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to personal information beyond KKFC reasonable control.</p>

			<p><strong>Disclosure of personal information to overseas recipients</strong></p>

			<p>In some cases, KKFC may disclose your personal information to overseas recipients, including but not limited to recipients in India and Singapore. KKFC employees and data processors are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by KKFC.</p>

			<p><strong>Access to personal information</strong></p>

			<p>You are in control of any personal information you provide to us. If at any time, you would like to access, review, correct and/or delete the personal information we have about you, or if you would like to change your preferences for contacts from us, you can let us know via the contact details listed below. Please allow 30 days for this request to be processed.</p>

			<p>Your personal information may be stored in different locations depending upon the reason for which you originally submitted the information. If you make an inquiry in relation to your personal information, the more information you can provide us about when you originally submitted your personal information, the quicker KKFC will be able to retrieve your personal information.</p>

			<p>If requested, all reasonable steps to delete personal information will be made, except where it is required for legal reasons. Deletion of information may result in KKFC being unable to facilitate or provide you with information about certain transactions (including the uploading of, access to, and receipt of, content on a Website or Application, and purchase transactions undertaken on a Website or Application), other content, services or product information, upcoming promotions, competitions or event information, and/or provide certain content, products or services.</p>

			<p>We are not responsible for removing your personal information from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided your information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

			<p><strong>Links to other sites</strong></p>

			<p>Our Websites or Applications may, from time to time, offer links to sites that may be of interest to you but which are not operated by KKFC. Their inclusion cannot be taken to imply any endorsement or validation by us of the content of the third party website. Linked websites are responsible for their own privacy practices. If you visit one of these linked websites, you should review their privacy and other policies. We are not responsible, nor do we accept any liability, for the policies, practices and conduct of other companies linked to any KKFC Website or Mobile Application.</p>

			<p>We may use third party advertisements on our Websites and Applications. All third party advertising, if paid for, is paid for by the relevant third party advertisers. Third party advertisements are not recommendations or endorsements by KKFC or any of its affiliates. To the extent permitted by law, KKFC is not responsible for the content (including representations) of any third party advertisement on a Website or Application. Cookies may be associated with these advertisements to enable the advertiser to track the number of anonymous users responding to the campaign.</p>

			<p><strong>Related KKFC Websites or Applications</strong></p>

			<p><strong>Franchisee privacy policies</strong></p>

			<p>Many KKFC restaurants will be owned and operated by franchisees, who are independent businessmen and businesswomen. Some franchisees also operate websites and are required to follow this privacy policy. If you are concerned that there may have been a breach of this privacy policy by a franchisee, please contact the relevant franchisee entity or KKFC restaurant directly.</p>

			<p><strong>Changes to our privacy policy</strong></p>

			<p>From time to time, it may be necessary for KKFC to change this privacy policy without notice. We will post any changes to this privacy policy on our Websites and Applications. Rest assured, however, that any changes will not be retroactively applied and will not alter how we handle previously collected personal information.</p>
